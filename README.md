# Gophetica

This is a collection of Go packages that I am using for my Go port 
of Frequon Invaders and might be of independent interest.

* `nimble`: lightweight graphics interface for video games.
* `math32`: 32-bit analog of Go math package
* `cmplx64`: 64-bit analog of Go cmplex package

The libraries have only the functionality that I need so far.
The two math packages need many more functions to fully match
their analogs.  Feel free to send pull requests to enhance them.
